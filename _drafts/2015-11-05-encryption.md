Encryption has been used for thousands of years with a very complex history.  Cryptography which is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means “secret”was dated about 2000 BC where the Egyptians carved hieroglyphs or complex pictograms into monuments.  The is one of the earliest known use of cryptography. The ancient hieroglyphs word literally translates as “language of Gods”.  The use of the inscriptions were used back in ancient Egypt for religious purposes but also to record historical events, write documents of importance and document calculations such as the depth of the Nile River throughout the year.  It wasn’t until the 1820’s that French Egyptologist Jean François Champollion was the first modern man who was able to decrypt these hieroglyphs.

One of the oldest encryption devices from back in the 7th century BC was a Spartan scytale.  The scytale was a tool used by the Spartan military to send private messages during military campaigns.   The sender or encryptor would write the message on a strip of parchment  which was then wound around a staff.  The message was unreadable until the receiver who would have an identical staff would rewrap the parchment unveiling the message. This may seem like a breeze to decrypt the message today, but back then most of the people could not read or write.

Modern day encryption has changed immensely. We now use computers as our form of cryptography since the human code is too easy to figure out.   

Encryption is still as important today as it was thousands of years ago especially when it comes to backing up your data.  Most companies encrypt your data before it is sent over the wire to give it extra security.
