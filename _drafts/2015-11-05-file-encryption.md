Encryption has been used for thousands of years with a very complex history.  Cryptography, the study of encryption, is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means “secret”.  one of the earliest known uses of encryption occurred around 2000 BC where the Egyptians carved hieroglyphs or complex pictograms into monuments.  The ancient hieroglyphs word literally translates as “language of Gods”.  The use of the inscriptions were used back in ancient Egypt for religious purposes but also to record historical events, write documents of importance and document calculations such as the depth of the Nile River throughout the year.  It wasn’t until the 1820’s that French Egyptologist Jean François Champollion was the first modern man who was able to decrypt these hieroglyphs.

One of the oldest encryption devices from back in the 7th century was a Spartan scytale.  The scytale was a tool used by the Spartan military to send private messages during military campaigns.   The sender or encryptor would write the message on a strip of parchment which was then wound around a staff.  The message was unreadable until the receiver, who would have an identical staff, would rewrap the parchment unveiling the message. This may seem like a breeze to decrypt the message today, but back then most of the people could not read or write.

Modern day encryption has changed immensely since the early days.  We now use computers as our primary form of cryptography since the human-readable encoding is too easy to figure out.   

Encryption is still as important today as it was thousands of years ago particularly when it comes to backing up your data, and especially if it will be stored in the cloud or with a third-party.  Most backup providors are able to encrypt your data before it is sent off-site.  While most encryption in use today is secure or "military-grade", encryption is an ever-changing landscape.
