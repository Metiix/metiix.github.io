Data Migration

Data migration is the process of importing or transferring data to a new system whether it be data storage systems, computer systems or different data formats.

Growth- need larger capacity
new storage system slow system because its slow. Upgrade Faster storage system or more capacity. its too slow and inefficient. need more iops. Running out of performance.
Format- version 1 current copy doesnt have certain functionality. version 2 can do it. migrate from one data format to another so use new capablilites of software.  changing one different format to another. new format has more options and capabilities and different newer version of application requires different format.


Data center relocation to consolidate geographically dispersed storage locations. DOnt put all eggs in basket and dipserse as a form of redundacy.
Data migration is the process of transferring data between data storage systems, data formats or computer

Before migration process make sure have backups in case you data mirgrations fail so you can roll back to a known good state.  do testing. take copy of data test it.  Test your data migration process within a test enviorment completely isolated from your production enviornment.

Data migration is used to describe the process of translating datafrom one format to another. Data migration is necessary when an organization decides to use a new computing systems or database management system that is incompatible with the current system. Typically, data migration is performed by a set of customizedprograms or scripts that automatically transfer the data.

Data migration is the process of transferring data between storage types, formats, or computer systems. It is a key consideration for any system implementation, upgrade, or consolidation. Data migration is usually performed programmatically to achieve an automated migration, freeing up human resources from tedious tasks. Data migration occurs for a variety of reasons, including server or storage equipment replacements, maintenance or upgrades, application migration, website consolidation and data center relocation

A data migration project is usually undertaken to replace or upgrade servers or storage equipment, for a website consolidation, to conduct server maintenance or to relocate a data center.



Data migration may impact business operations when it creates extended downtime, compatibility and performance issues. 
Although migrating data can be a fairly time-consuming process, the benefits can be worth the cost
Data migration. This can involve entering the data manually, moving disk files from one folder (or computer) to another, database insert queries, developing custom software, or other methods. The specific method used for any particular system depends entirely on the systems involved and the nature and state of the data being migrated.
Bottom Line. Data migration is a key element to consider when adopting any new system either through purchase or new development. Data migration is not a simplistic task and if not given due consideration early in the process of developing or purchasing a new system it could become a very expensive task.

it is a key consideration for any system implementation, upgrade or consolidation.




Factors to consider in a data migration project include how long the migration will take; the amount of downtime required; and the risk to the business from technical compatibility issues, data corruption, application performance issues, and missed data or data loss.
There are three broad categories of data movers:

Host-based software is best for application-specific migrations such as platformupgrades and for database replication and file copying.
Array-based software is primarily used to migrate data between like systems.
Network appliances migrate volumes, files or blocks of data depending on their configuration.

The following best practices should be used to protect data during a migration Understand what data you are migrating, where it lives, what form it's in and the form it will take at its new destination.Extract, transform and deduplicate data before moving it.Implement data migration policies so data is moved in an orderly manner.Test and validate the migrated data to ensure it is accurate.Audit and document the entire data migration process.
