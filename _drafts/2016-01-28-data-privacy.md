Data Privacy - How it relates to backup or small business or data that is stored in the cloud
 
Data privacy is the aspect of information technology that concerns the collection and protection of private information about individuals or organizations, in which they determine what data in a computer system can be shared with third parties.  Cloud data privacy issues are concerns for companies either moving or who are already using the cloud.
 
Cloud data privacy laws differ considerably among countries.  While the United States has very harsh laws with HIPAA or The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Germany has one of the most strict policies in the nation.
 
Make sure you trust who is protecting your data, the fewer copies you have, the easier it is to protect.
