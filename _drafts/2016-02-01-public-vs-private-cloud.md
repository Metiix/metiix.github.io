### Private cloud
 
- Private cloud is dedicated to a single organization. With private cloud all the maintenance and management is the organizations responsibility.  Private cloud is best for mid-to-large size organizations that have fluctuating needs.  You also have direct control over your data and environments. 

- Private cloud offers added security because your data is protected behind a firewall under the control of your IT department, some companies host their private cloud with an external third-party provider.  Private cloud is more expensive, but you have the ability to customize your specific IT requirements and needs.
 
- Along with better security and more flexibility, your private cloud is not shared with other organizations, whether managed on-site or by a service provider.  Hardware performance, network performance and storage performance can be specified and customized in the private cloud to meet the demands of your specific workflow.
 
### Public cloud
 
- Managing and securing data is the responsibility of the vendor/partner.
- Public cloud is managed by a provider that stores your data in their data center. 
- No contracts. Saves you money.  You pay a fee-for service often based on utilization and data volume.
- By spreading infrastructure costs are across a number of users, each can operate on a low-cost plan. 
- No hardware or maintenance costs incurred by your business.
- Primary benefits of the public cloud are the speed with which you can deploy IT resources.
- Easy and inexpensive set-up because hardware, application and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.
- Scalability to meet needs.
- No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.
