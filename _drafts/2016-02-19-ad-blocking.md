## A New Post

Ad blocking has been around on the desktop browsers for years.  Beginning in 2015 this technology has went mobile.

Recently Google removed their Samsung ad blocking app from Play store.  This app had racked up more than 50,000 downloads and was one of the top downloads of the play store.

Ad blocking is a technology which blocks ads before they are loaded by the web browser.  Ad blockers are applications that remove all or alter some of the advertisments on a web page.  Some applications eliminate all ads where as some others block things that could compromise a userâ€™s privacy.  When ads are tracking your activity through a third party, they are able to track exactly what you are looking at online as well as how long you are spending on websites.  This information can be sold to marketers. 

The ad block is a software or hardware that removes ads from a webpage.  While the webpage is loading, the ad block filters content by checking  and comparing blacklist names and stopping them from loading.

Ad blocking means you are saving bandwidth and you will have faster performance.

Most often Ad blocking blocks all ads, but it also stops malware and tracking.

Performance is a big benefit for using an ad blocker.  There are dozens of ads on a page making your browser loading time drastically slower.  Not only will an ad blocker increase load times, it will also improve battery life and less likely to crash due to overload.

Another benefit is protecting your security and privacy.  Users are getting infected with viruses and malware.  Ad networks can track and collect information about a users activity and pages they have visited.  The software prevents third-party tracking.  You should be able to browse the web privately without being monitored and watched.
