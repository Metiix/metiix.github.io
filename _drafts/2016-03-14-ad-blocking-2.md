title: Ad Blocking 2
---


## A New Post
Ad blocking is growing rapidly worldwide.  There are close to 200 million internet users actively using adblock application when going online.

Consumers are more likely to block ads with concerns that websites are using personal data and that the ads are becoming very frequent and annoying.

Websites have software to detect whether a visitor is using a blocker and in return send a message or forbid you to even enter their website.  There are several websites that are not allowing users with ad blockers to enter their websites.   Forbes is just one to name where if using an ad blocker, you are greeted with a welcome screen that asks you to turn off your ad blocker in order to continue into the website.


Digital advertising is a 60 billion dollar a year business in the United States. With ad blocking becoming increasing popular, more than 25 percent of the population has ad blockers.  The industry claims they are losing money.

YouTube is considering offering an ad-free version of its site to paying subscribers.
FairBlocker, which started in February has a subscription that allows users to pay to see the content they want without ads.
