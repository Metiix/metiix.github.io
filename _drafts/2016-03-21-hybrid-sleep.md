title: Hybrid Sleep
---

Hybrid sleep was introduced in 2007 as part of Windows Vista.  Hybrid sleep is a combination of sleep and hibernate mode.  Hybrid sleep triggers your computer into low-power state to RAM (like sleep mode), while writing active data to the hard drive (like hibernation) when enabled. Once disabled, you can resume the computer quickly from sleep.
 
Not only does Hybrid sleep allow you to wake the computer rapidly, but also protects user data with a copy on the hard drive in the event of a power failure of system shutdown.
 
Hybrid sleep is designed primarily for desktop computers.  Hybrid Sleep is on by default for desktop systems but off by default on most laptops.  You are able to override the default for your laptop easily if you choose.  Using Hybrid sleep on your laptop may be unnecessary since it runs on a battery and not power, so you will not have to worry about a power outage.
 
In order to enable Hybrid sleep you can do so by going to Control Panel>Power options>Edit plan Settings>Change Advanced Power Settings>Sleep>Allow Hybrid Sleep.
