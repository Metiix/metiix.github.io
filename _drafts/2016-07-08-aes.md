Advanced Encryption Standard is one of the most favorable and widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm encountered today.  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm.

AES, also known as Rinjndael, which is its original name was developed by two Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen back in 2000.  AES is based on the Rijndael cipher where the two cryptographers submitted a proposal to National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) during the AES selection process.

AES was designed to be efficient in both hardware and software. AES performs its computations on bytes rather than bits.  AES conists of three block ciphers, AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. Each standard cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using cryptographic keys of 128-, 192- and 256-bits. The algorithm used by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
 

AES not only provides security, but it also improves performance in a variety of settings such as hardware implementations.

AES encryption is used by the US government for securing sensitive material and is now used worldwide.
