title: RAM and ROM

RAM and ROM are two different computer memory systems. RAM stands for Random Accessing Memory. RAM can best be described as the main or primary system for storage. ROM, Read-Only Memory, is data that has been written onto a chip, and can only be read. 

A ROM chip is non-volatile, while a RAM chip is volatile. Non-volatile means any memory is saved whether the computer is on or not. One example of a non-volatile memory is a hard drive. Data stays on the hard drive, even if the power is obstructed. Volatile means data will be erased if the power is obstructed. 

There are two types of RAM, called SRAM and DRAM. SRAM is faster because it does not need to be refreshed. On the other hand, DRAM is refreshed thousands of times per second, which makes it slower than SRAM. A ROM chip is usually used in the start up process of a computer. A RAM chip is used to store information and run programs. A RAM chip stores a significant amount of data, whereas, a ROM chip only stores a few megabytes. 


To sum it up, ROM cannot be re-written and contains the program to start up a computer. RAM runs applications and stores data, it can also be easily altered.
