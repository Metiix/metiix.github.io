title: Rebooting your computerled
---
Should you be shutting down or rebooting your computer systems?  Obviously keeping your computer running and powered 24/7 is the more convenient option because your machine is always on and ready to go. 
You may think shutting off or restarting may be harmful to your system or cause you to lose data, but that is incorrect.  Restarting and shutting down your PC is actually beneficial.
Having to remember to shut down and restart can be a nuisance, but this problem can easily be solved by automating a shutdown and startup schedule.  This programs your computer to shut down and restart automatically. 

When you reboot your computer you are turning it off and then back on again.  When restarting you are closing all programs and also clearing out all the RAM on your system.  Restarting flushes your RAM (random access memory) which handles short term task and data. 
You may be prompted to restart whenever you install or update software.  Often, you must restart to download and install updates and patches that help it run smoothly.

Shutting down also keeps your machine from having less trivial problems that are simply solved by a reboot.  This helps give your machine a fresh new start which in turn helps it run faster and more efficiently. Rebooting your computer runs diagnostics on itself and automatically fixes minor errors.  Simple restarting is often times an effective and fast way for troubleshooting if you are experiencing issues especially a slow running computer or loud running fan.  If your computer is running slow or your fans are loud, it might be a good time for a restart.


Although you can use hibernation mode or sleep mode,  it’s not the same as restarting. 
Computers use up a lot of energy.  One of the simple benefits of shutting down your system is that you won’t draw as much power, lowering your energy costs. 
Less activity can also make your hardware last longer.

Your computer does plenty of work while you sleep such as uploading, downloading, system maintenance and even backing up, it is still essential to restart and shut down once in a while..
