title: Worst mistakes for data backup
---
 
First of all having no data back up at all is the worst mistake you can make.
Keep in mind that even when you are backing up your data, be sure your backup jobs are running efficiently.  Be sure to check logs and correct errors or malfunctions as soon as possible.
Not having your data stored offsite is a big mistake.  Storing your data offsite in case of a natural disaster such as a fire, flood, or other catastrophe is vital and also gives you peace of mind in the case an unfortunate event did take place.
Data Encryption is very important for securing your data.  By not doing so, you run the risk of your data being hacked.
 
After your backup job has finished without errors it is still important to run test restores on your data.  Periodically testing data is the only way to be sure everything is running effectively and smoothly.
