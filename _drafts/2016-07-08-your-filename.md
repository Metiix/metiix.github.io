Disaster recovery involves security planning that makes the recovery of important technology infrastructure and systems possible after a disaster. These disasters can be natural or man made disasters. Some possible man made disasters are those such as; infrastructure failure, IT bugs, cyberattacks, and failed implementations. 

Natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and tornados are impossible to prevent, but good planning can keep your IT infrastructure safe. Disaster recovery will reduce the negative effects of the disaster and allow the business to continue mission-critical functions as soon as possible. Only 1% of data loss is due to natural disasters. Most data loss is from hardware failure, human error, security breaches and viruses. 60% of businesses that lose their data are likely to shut down within 6 months. 25% of companies use cloud storage as their Disaster Recovery Plan. 20% of these users recover within 4 hours of the disaster. 

Disaster recovery is essential for keeping your company's systems and infrastructure safe.
