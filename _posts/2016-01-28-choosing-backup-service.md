What do you need to look for in choosing a good backup service?  It is important to protect your company from human error, software corruption or even a disaster which can cause data loss.
 
When choosing a backup solution, you have many things to consider.
You should evaluate your storage needs.  Consider the amount of data you have and the expectation of how much data your business will need.  Storage is a very important aspect when considering backup storage. 
 
Make sure they support the platform that you are backing up. Choose a backup service with a redundant data site.
 
Look for providers that with pricing plans that meet your organizationâ€™s needs.  Some services charge per unit of data while others charge per device that is being backed up; often times combining both to meet your needs. Most service providers provide unlimited backup at a fixed price.  Providers also have yearly or biannual plans, but monthly is typically also an option.
 
Security is another important factor when choosing a provider.  Make sure they have top notch encryption.  Some providers even go beyond encryption and in addition add a  privacy option.  The best online backup companies are also offering additional security layer, and are compressing and encrypting the data
 
Customer service also plays a factor.  Many providers boast 24/7 backup support.  Alerts are sent via email bringing issues/problems with your servers to your attention right away.
 
Some even provide extra services such as free disk space monitoring.   
 
While establishing your needs which may include: how frequently you want to restore your data and how fast you want to back it up.  How long will it take to recover your date in the case of an emergency; hours, days?
