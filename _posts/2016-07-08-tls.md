Transport Layer Security otherwise known as TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between communications over the internet. 
 
TLS is a successor to Secure Sockets Layer protocol or SSL.  TLS is frequently still referred to as SSL because it is a more commonly used term.  Although TLS is a more updated secure version of SSL, there are very few differences between the two.
 
 
When running TLS, the server and client can authenticate each other using cryptographic keys before transmitting or receiving the first byte of data.  When used with a web server TLS will encrypt online transactions and confidential data between a web browser and website. 
 
Transport layer security is performed in the following order:
 
The client and server agree on an algorithm
A key is exchanged using encryption
A Symmetric cipher is used the data exchange
 
Implementation is inexpensive and simple.  The process doesn’t require changes to your desktop and TLS doesn’t inhibit the ability to protect against spam or a virus. 
 
One disadvantage of TLS is that the message is only encrypted while in transit, not sender to recipient and TLS cannot establish the identity of the sender, just the sender’s gateway.
 
Users are able to access secured websites with TLS through a system called Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which you will see a green padlock icon in your URL window while accessing secure sites.
