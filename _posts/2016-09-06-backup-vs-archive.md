title: Backup Vs Archive
---
Data backup and archives are both different technologies.   They both support primary data storage, but there are a few differences between the two.
 
The main purpose of backup is to recover data.  Backup protects both active and inactive data.   You can recover data if its been lost by human error, corruption or natural disaster.   Backup data is written to reduplication for faster access to large amounts of information.   Things happen as far as online hardware fails, data is lost or you want to go back in time and recover data.  Backup lets you restore your data exactly the same way it was originally on the file system.
 
Data archive is often used to keep older or irrelevant data for extended periods of time with quick access to stored information. The data that is no longer actively used is sent to a separate storage device for long term retention.   Archives store individual data objects such as email messages, files and databases. There is very little cost and primary storage consumption is reduced with archiving.  Archives hold production data where a disaster, error, or loss could result the inability to restore the data.
 
You can easily both technologies in your overall business plan.  While backup is used for recovery and archiving is used to for long-term preservation and retention, they both can be used together..
