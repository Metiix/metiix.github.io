Chromebooks are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with majority of its applications and documents living in the Google cloud. Cloud storage can get expensive, but Google throws in 100 GB of storage for free.  Some great Google apps such as Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Drive are a great benefit.  Google drive is a great application for small business’ that lets users create text documents, presentations and spreadsheets.  For convenience, are able to stay synced with your Android phones or tablet as long as you’re signed into Google.
 
Chromebooks run on an operating system called Chrome OS, which is similar to Windows, but sits on top of a Linux Platform.  These devices come with an SSD or solid-state drive disk.  SSD contains neither a disk or a rivet motor to spin, it is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, which results in incredibly fast boot times and speedy file management.
 
Security is important when it comes to dealing with your personal and business life.  The chrome OS also has built in virus and malware protection as an added security bonus. Google also keeps their operating system secure by restricting what can be installed.  With Chrome, third party apps are allowed, but only in the form of a Chrome extension.   
 
Another advantage that makes the Chromebook appealing is the system automatically updates with no cost.  Updating takes literally seconds and then continues as if nothing happened, making your device up to date and working at all times .
 
Chromebooks are Google’s take on laptops.  Majority of Chromebooks cost less than most laptops, making them an affordable option for your business or home
