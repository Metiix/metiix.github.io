title: HDD and SSD
---
Both hard drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) are storage devices.  While both serve the same purpose, their methods are very different.
 
A Solid state drive (SSD) is a non-volatile storage device.  SSD stands for Solid State Disk, which it means storage that doesn’t require moving parts. SSDs use motionless technology called NAND flash memory and the data is stored in cells. SSD was originally RAM-based before using Flash instead.   SSD uses non-volatile memory for storing and accessing data, which means SSD doesn’t require continuous power, therefore not having to worry about data loss.
 
Hard Drives on the other hand have moving parts.  HDDs store data by writing to a disc via magnetism.  Inside the drive, there is a stack of magnetic discs called platters that spin at very fast speeds.
