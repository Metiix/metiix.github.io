Is the Cloud safe?
 
Many small businesses rely on older technology which increases the odds of losing  important data.  With cloud storage, you are able to move your excess data to an off- site storage facility, while freeing up space on your computer.   It is important to have your data stored in the cloud in the event of a failure.
 
Keeping  your data secure and safe is not only your cloud providerâ€™s responsibility, but your responsibility as well.

Encryption plays a big part in protection as it utilizes complex algorithms to conceal cloud protected information.
