These attacks are happening everyday in the world.  Cybercriminals are looking to make money off of unprotected and unsuspecting users every day in the business world. 
 
Malware, short for malicious software is installed on your PC usually without your knowledge.  Once malware is on your PC, it is capable of logging your passwords, tracking your surfing habits, gaining access to your banking accounts, and even withholding important data for ransom.
 
How does your computer get infected? First off the malware enters your PC from a download from a website or email that the malware infects by clicking or installing a program.  The user typically has no idea the invasion has begun.
 
Once infected, the malicious code executes actions such as self replicating, restricting access to files and programs and even holding your data for ransom.
 
A few signs your PC may be infected include:
 
Slow operating system
Excessive pop-up ads
You are unable to access your antivirus program
Your computer crashes
When accessing one page, you are directed to a different site
Unfamiliar programs and toolbars
Browser is slow
 
To better protect your data and yourself from an attack always have an Antivirus software, active firewall and a strong password.  You must also ensure you have a solid offline backup strategy in place.
