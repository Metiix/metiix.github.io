Open source technology is a rapid growing software in which the source code used to create the program is freely available for the public to view, redistribute and modify as well.  Non-open software is called closed source or proprietary software.  Any type of software program can be open source, including operating systems, applications, databases and even games.
 
 
When businesses turn to open source software, they are free from the lock in that can force users of using vendor proprietary packages. One of the most popular and well know open source operating systems is Linux.  The Linux OS has an open source paradigm, whereas Windows which is closed paradigm.  One advantage of open source is the wide range of options available to users and the increased security it offers.  Most often malware is created to attack Windows and is typically not found in Linux.   Open source has far fewer security patches to download and install and Bugs in open source software also tend to get fixed immediately.
 
Linux software is free to obtain and use. 
 
Linux is a great option to use on older computers. Open source software is typically much less resource-intensive, so that it can run it well even on older hardware.
 
The Linux users insure development and maintenance of the software.  As long as there are users, Linux will never go and will continue to develop and grow.
